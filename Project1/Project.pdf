You will write a C++ program that will optimize some 2D shapes and produce SVG (Scalable
Vector Graphics) files to display calculated 2D graphics.
Your program will have a main container shape (rectangle, circle). It will try to fit many
small shapes (rectangle, circle ) in the main container shape by carefully placing these
shapes into the container shape.
The result file should be stored in result.svg
