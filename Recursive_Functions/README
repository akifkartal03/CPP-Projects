1) In this task you will write a recursive fuction that takes a template vector. This function will calculate and return average value of 
this vector.

2) In this task you will write a recursive function that takes an integer number as a parameter. This function will convert your decimal 
number to a binary number and print it on the screen. For example you will give 10 to function as an argument then it will print 1010.

3) 
  A) Write a recursive Template function that takes a vector and a key value. If the key value is in the vector your funcction will return
  true otherwise it will return false.
  
  B) Write a recursive template function that takes a vector . If the vector contains repetitive elements then add this element another
  vector and return a new vector.Also in this fuction you have to use funtion that mentioned above in "A" option.
